## Repository Structure

- **train.csv**: The training dataset used to train the machine learning model. This dataset contains features and labels for loan eligibility.
- **test.csv**: The test dataset used to evaluate the model's performance. This dataset contains only the features without the labels.
- **submission.csv**: A sample submission file used to demonstrate the format of the final model output.
- **mynotes.ipynb**: A Jupyter Notebook containing the code, explanations, and results of the loan eligibility prediction model. It includes:
  - Data loading and exploration
  - Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding, etc.)
  - Feature selection
  - Model training and tuning
  - Model evaluation and predictions

## Project Overview

Loan eligibility prediction is a crucial task for financial institutions. The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can help assess an applicant's eligibility for a loan based on factors like income, loan amount, credit history, etc.
